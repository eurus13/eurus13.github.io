title: Bananas Bananas Bananas 
---


I found that I can spend a lot time looking for datasets that reveal new hidden data .. a LOT OF TIME. Which while is fun in it's 
own right, is counter to producing more content to highlight the skills I have been learning. 

I decided to look at data visualizations from other people, and see how I can improve them. 

Visualizing data is tough work, and this is not meant to diminsh any efforts a person had put into their work. I am approaching it 
as it didn't make quick sesne for me, and while it may to some .. there are probably a few people like myself that would benefit from
a different approach. 



# Case 1 - Bananas oh so many bananas

## What doesn't work for me:
1. Some Data is covered up (see phillipines)
2. Since this is a time based plot, I like a line graph instead of a bar chart. 
3. It is VERY HARD to accurately tell the amount of bananas per year after 1995. 
4. The color coding makes more sense to my brain linked to the countries rather than year. 
 
 ## Getting the Data
 
 I first went to a few sites to try and find the same data set. I was unable to located it, so I resotred to just pulling
 the data straight from the chart. (see 1. and 3. What doesn't work for me)
 
 I started using a pencil pointing at the screen .. slowly working my way through year by year. I quickly switched
 switched to country by country and extended the perspective lines with altenrating between orange and red in Inkscape. The lines aren't perfect but I'm just attempting
 to show the gist of the data, and was not aiming for 100% accuracy.

  ## Jupyter Notebook
  
  After I got the data, I built my dataframe with pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. I decided to use plotly to make my plot interactive.

  ## Final [Result](https://plot.ly/~eurus13/1/)
  
   This is a static shot of the visualiztion, but here is the [link](https://plot.ly/~eurus13/1/) to the interactive version hosted on plotly.
