title: Data Types

For some the concept of data types **[Continous or Discrete]** can get slippery when applying it to strict categories. 

It feels similarly to the existential captchas where you must decide if the sliver of crosswalk or mininscule overlap of the bus tire is enough to consider the square selectable to prove your human .. and I've often been locked out of a website wondering about by humanity .. subtly morphing from captcha into gotcha- [Verge: Why CAPTCHAs have gotten so difficult](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence)

__Example:__

**Discrete**
If you count how many apples are in a bucket- that is a discrete(limited) set or quanitity.

**Continuous**
If you measure the circumfrence of each apple in the bucket, there is no set size or limit in relation to the group. It is free to float to any value, and you are free to refine your measuring tool.
