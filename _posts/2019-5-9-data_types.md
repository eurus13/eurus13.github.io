For some the concept of data types **[Continous or Discrete]** can get slippery when applying it to strict categories. 

It feels similarly to the existential captchas where you must decide if the sliver of crosswalk or mininscule overlap of the bus tire is enough to consider the square selectable to prove your human .. and I've often been locked out of a website wondering about by humanity .. subtly morphing from captcha to gotcha- [Verge: Why CAPTCHAs have gotten so difficult](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence)

# Back to Data Types, and how I make sense of them quickly.

Most places I've read start with discrete, probably because it is easier, but going from contious to discrete works as well. 

Continous:  I've come across lots of definitions, but the one that works for my brain is **if you can measure it, it is continous**
you can always add more precision to the measurement, such as going from miles to feet to inches, making it a continous spectrum of possibility 


Discrete: You can't refine your measurements of a person. 1 person is a person. So counting the number of students in a school would be
discrete. Measuring the height of each indivdual in the school would be continous, there is no **set** or set value the height must reside in.


So in shortL Continous if you measure, and discrete if you are counting.
