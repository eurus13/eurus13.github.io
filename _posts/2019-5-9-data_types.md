title: Data Types

For some the concept of data types can get slippery when applying it to strict categories. 

It honestly feels a bit similar to the captchas where you must decide if the sliver of crosswalk or mininscule overlap of the bus tire is enough to consider the square selectable to prove your human.
I've often been left wondering about whether I am actually a robot or just incapable human at the mercy 
of captcha .. 

Here is an interesting read on why captcha has taken gaslighting us.

Back to Data Types, and how I make sense of them quickly.



Most places I've read start with discrete, probably because it is easier, but going from contious to discrete works as well. 

Continous:  I've come across lots of definitions, but the one that works for my brain is **if you can measure it, it is continous**
you can always add more precision to the measurement, such as going from miles to feet to inches, making it a continous spectrum of possibility 


Discrete: You can't refine your measurements of a person. 1 person is a person. So counting the number of students in a school would be
discrete. Measuring the height of each indivdual in the school would be continous, there is no **set** or set value the height must reside in.


So in shortL Continous if you measure, and discrete if you are counting.
