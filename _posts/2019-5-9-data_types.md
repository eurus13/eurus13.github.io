title: Data Types

For some the concept of data types **[Continous or Discrete]** can get slippery when applying it to strict categories. 

It feels similarly to the existential captchas where you must decide if the sliver of crosswalk or mininscule overlap of the bus tire is enough to consider the square selectable to prove your human .. and I've often been locked out of a website wondering about by humanity .. subtly morphing from captcha to gotcha- [Verge: Why CAPTCHAs have gotten so difficult](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence)

# Back to Data Types,and how I make sense of them quickly.

> If you  measure it, it is **continous**
> If you count it, it's **discrete**

Example:

**Discrete**
If you count how many apples are in a bucket- that is a discrete(limited) set or quanitity.

**Continuous**
If you measure the circumfrence of each apple in the bucket, there is no set or limit in relation to the group.
